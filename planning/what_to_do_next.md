## next step
- routing (create password => generate password;  password => url_password db; users => users db)
- display db in frontend
- edit the passwords
- catergorize urls
- different users base of cookies eg: user_id:1 would be john, user_id:3 would be bob
- Change the redirect page for when you save the password (create password page, where the emoji is)
